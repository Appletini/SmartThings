README

This is a repository for the SartThings 'SmartApps' and 'Devices' that I am working on. 

Notes: 
If the file has _device at the end of the file name it gets added as a custom device in SmartThings. 

If you want to use the Hue Lights and Groups (connect) you must also install the ZP_Hue custom devices because there is some additional functionality that I am working on in the Hue API.
